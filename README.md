# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The goal of this study guide is to offer boot camp students a resource they can employ to make the learning process more organized and didactic. This guide offers the main four topics that are covered in the pre-work section of the boot camp, and students can organize their notes under each topic's title. Those topics are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The creation of this guide helped me to organize the content taught in the pre-work and prepared me for the upcoming applications of the four topics at the boot camp.
